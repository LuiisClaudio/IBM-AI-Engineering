1.  **Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras**
2.  **Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow**
3.  **Introduction to Neural Networks and PyTorch**
4.  **Deep Learning with PyTorch**
5.  **AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning**
6.  **Generative AI and LLMs: Architecture and Data Preparation**
7.  **Gen AI Foundational Models for NLP & Language Understanding**
8.  **Generative AI Language Modeling with Transformers**
9.  **Generative AI Engineering and Fine-Tuning Transformers**
10. **Generative AI Advance Fine-Tuning for LLMs**
11. **Fundamentals of AI Agents Using RAG and LangChain**
12. **Project: Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain**
